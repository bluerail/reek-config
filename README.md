# Bluerail Reek Config

## Usage
Unlike Rubocop, I'm unaware of inheriting remote modules, so you'll have to grab the .reek file and put it in your project directory. Alternatively, checkout the repo and symlink ~/.reek to the repo's .reek for a global, easy-to-update config.

## Requirements
- Reek!
